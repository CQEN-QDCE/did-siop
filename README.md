# SIOP DID Profile

The spec is based on the SIOP specification that is part of the OIDC core specification.
The current working draft can be found here: https://identity.foundation/did-siop

:exclamation: The current version of DID SIOP is v0.1 and is an unapproved WG draft. The work on DIF SIOP DID Profile specification has moved to OIDF AB WG to work on a new SIOP v2 specification that will likely introduce breaking changes to the DIF SIOP DID Profile specification. :exclamation:
